A simple interactive fiction system modeled after behaviors in 3D survival horror games to serve as an outlining and prototyping tool for that style of game.

Although traditional IF commands are supported (`LOOK`, `EXAMINE`, and `USE`, along with navigation), the preferred interaction with SHIFT games is through naming objects and directions only. Player input is context-sensitive and prompts with a menu when multiple options are available instead of requiring a specific verb for actions.

A developer specifies their game through a brief, readable, and writable scripting language also called SHIFT, with the `.shift` extension.

See the [SHIFT Scripting Specification](doc/ShiftSpec.md) for more detailed information on scripting.

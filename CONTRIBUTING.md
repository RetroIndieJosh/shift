# Contributing to SHIFT

I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features (see NOTE below)

NOTE: Although there is room for new feature requests in the issue tracker, I
would prefer not to overwhelm the tracker with features planned in these
documents, so please limit to bug reporting for now.

SHIFT is in early stages of development and may shift direction (pun?) and
experience large overhauls from time to time.

Please have a look through the [to-do list](TODO.md) and the [SHIFT
specification](doc/ShiftSpec.md) to get an idea of what is already planned. 

## Creating a Pull Request

Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). All
external code changes happen through pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.  2. If you've added code
that should be tested, add tests.  3. If you've changed APIs, update the
documentation.  4. Ensure the test suite passes.  5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Bug Reporting

Report bugs through the GitHub [issue
tracker](https://github.com/RetroIndieJosh/shift/issues) by [opening a new
issue](https://github.com/RetroIndieJosh/shift/issues/new). It's that easy!

Here's an [example of a great bug report by Craig
Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great bug reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow
    question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code
that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you
  tried that didn't work)

I *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* If you use VS Code, you can use the included .editorconfig file to get
* started A code style guide is forthcoming For now, try to match the style of
* existing code
